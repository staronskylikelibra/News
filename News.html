                        The Chinese Communist Party has finally unveiled the men who will rule <br>China for the next five years.
                    </strong>
                    <p>
                        The Politburo Standing Committee is China's equivalent of the presidential <br>cabinet.
                    </p>
                    <p>It is considered the elite of the elite within the party, and getting to the top <br>often requires not only a stellar political track record, but also deft <br>manoeuvring of internal rivalries.</p>
                    <p>It is not unusual to see big reshuffles of the Standing Committee after a term <br>ends, and this time it is no different.</p>
                    <p>Effectively handpicked by President Xi Jinping, most of them are new to the <br>team apart from Zhao Leji and Wang Huning. Most, if not all, are seen to be Xi <br>loyalists.</p>
                    <p>Here are the men who, led by President Xi, make up the power centre of China.</p>

                    <strong>Li Qiang</strong>
                    <p>Age: 63</p>
                    <p>Current political post: Party secretary of Shanghai</p>
                    <p>Seen as Xi's most trusted junior colleague, Li worked in small counties in <br>Zhejiang province. When Xi was party chief <br>of Zhejiang, Li served as his chief of staff.</p>
                    <p>His team's handling of the Covid outbreak in Shanghai earlier this year was <br>contentious and residents were critical of it. There was speculation on whether <br>this could have affected his political future.</p>
                    <p>But with this appointment, it is clear his loyalty to Xi has placed him in good <br>stead. The titles of the members in the Standing Committee will be confirmed <br>next year, and many believe Li will become the next Premier, the second-in-<br>command after Xi.</p>

                    <strong>Zhao Leji</strong>
                    <p>Age: 65</p>
                    <p>Current political post: Head of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection</p>
                    <p>Zhao has been seen as a rising star in the Chinese leadership, and has close <br>links to the Shaanxi province, much like Xi.</p>
                    <p>After entering the Qinghai provincial government, he swiftly rose up the <br>ladder and became governor at the age of 42 - the youngest person to become <br>a provincial governor.</p>
                    <p>As the head of the anti-corruption body, Zhao is responsible for maintaining <br>party discipline and has reported a number of senior officers for accepting <br>bribes throughout the years.</p>

                    <strong>Wang Huning</strong>
                    <p>Age: 67</p>
                    <p>Current political ranking: First secretary of the Communist Party's Secretariat</p>
                    <p>A former scholar and professor, Wang rose through the ranks after catching <br>the eye of senior politicians. He was recommended to then-president Jiang <br>Zemin and promoted to become Jiang's consultant.</p>
                    <p>As the party's political theorist, Wang is considered to be the brains behind <br>many Communist Party concepts, including the ideologies for three leaders: <br>the Three Represents of Jiang Zemin, the Scientific Outlook on Development <br>of Hu Jintao, and Xi Jinping Thought. China's ambitious Belt and Road <br>Initiative was also believed to be his idea.</p>
                    <p>He is said to get along well with all factions in the party.</p>

                    <p>Current political ranking: Mayor of Beijing</p>
                    <p>A close ally of Xi, he has worked under the Chinese leader in the Fujian and <br>Zhejiang provinces and has called for absolute loyalty to him.</p>
                    <p>Beijing's hosting of the Winter Olympics earlier this year, at the height of the <br>pandemic, was seen within the party as a success and reflected well on him.</p>
                    <p>But he also attracted controversy when he launched a plan in 2017 to reduce <br>the population of the capital, that ultimately forced out many low-income <br>earners from the city.</p>

                    <p>A trained engineer, Ding started his political career at a government-affiliated <br>research centre in Shanghai.</p>
                    <p>Though he lacked experience as a provincial-level party secretary or governor <br>- usually considered essential in the climb to power - he became Xi's secretary <br>in 2007. Since 2014 he has been the head of the presidential office, effectively <br>acting as Xi's chief-of-staff.</p>
                    <p>A strong advocate of Xi Jinping Thought, he is one of Xi's most trusted aides.<br> He has accompanied the Chinese leader for many trips within China as well as <br>abroad - observers say he has probably spent more time with Xi than any other <br>official in recent years.</p>

                    <p>A Xi loyalist with close ties to the Chinese leader's family, Li is seen as a crisis-<br>solver for handling a 2017 scandal in Liaoning province over falsified economic <br>data.</p>
                    <p>He was the party leader in the politically significant city of Yanan, which Mao <br>Zedong used as the party's headquarters during World War Two and where Xi <br>spent seven years of hard labour.</p>
                    <p>In Guangdong, Li pushed for the development of the tech industry and <br>economic reform. He also issued new trade policies and promoted regional <br>integration in the area.</p>
